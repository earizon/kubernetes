## Okteto 
* A Tool to Develop Applications in Kubernetes
* <https://github.com/okteto/okteto/blob/master/README.md>
* <https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/01/qa-okteto-kubernetes-development/>

> We created a few guides to get you started with your favorite programming language:
* ASP.NET Core
* Golang
* Java Gradle
* Java Maven
* Node
* PHP
* Python
* Ruby

... development practices have not evolved at the same
speed as application deployment patterns.

... most developers try to either run parts of the
infrastructure locally or just test their integrations 
directly in the cluster via CI jobs, or the docker
build/redeploy cycle. It works, but this workflow is
painful and incredibly slow.

okteto accelerates the development workflow of Kubernetes 
applications. You write your code locally and okteto detects 
the changes and instantly updates your Kubernetes applications.

## How it works

**... development inside a container ... with seamless IDE and
tool integration as if you were working locally but with the 
resources of a remote cluster.
... When you run okteto up your Kubernetes deployment is 
replaced by a Development Container that contains your 
development tools (e.g. maven and jdk, or npm, python, 
go compiler, debuggers, etc).
 This development container can use any docker image. 
The development container inherits the same secrets, configmaps, 
volumes or any other configuration value of the original Kubernetes 
deployment**.
