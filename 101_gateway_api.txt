## How to Move from Ingress to Gateway API with Minimal Hassle

- By Keith Mattix, Microsoft

- For many, the Ingress resource was one of the first Kubernetes APIs they used,
  adding HTTP routing rules and SSL certs for cluster-external traffic.
- These APIs are used for production in clusters across the world today,
  configuring ingress gateways serving hundreds of thousands of connections per second.
- As of October 2023, the Ingress API has been superseded by the Gateway API,
  a new set of Kubernetes resources with over 20 implementations that enforces 
  security best practices by design. 
- Join this session to learn how to make this migration safe by identifying the
  best migration path, implementing Gateway API best practices, and utilizing
  community-supported migration tools such as ingress2gateway.

  ```

## Gateway API Model
* Role-oriented: API resources model organizational roles that use 
                 and configure K8s service networking.
*      Portable: Just as Ingress, a universal specification with 
                  numerous implementations.
*    Expressive: core functionality for things like header-based matching,
                 traffic weighting, and other capabilities that were only
                 possible in Ingress through custom annotations.
*    Extensible: allows for custom resources to be linked at various layers 
                 of the API.

<!--
The detailed process is as follows:
- The infrastructure provider provides GatewayClass and Gateway 
  Controller.
- Platform operator deploy Gateway (multiple deployments possible, or 
  using different GatewayClasses).
- Gateway Controller continuously monitors changes to the 
  GatewayClass and Gateway objects in the Kubernetes API Server.
- Gateway controller will create the corresponding gateway based on 
  cluster operations and maintenance configuration.
- Application developers apply xRoutes and bind them to the service.
- If in the cloud, the client accesses the load balancer for that 
  ingress gateway.<br/>
  The gateway will route to the corresponding back-end service based 
  on the matching criteria in the traffic request.

## Traefik

* ... 2024-10-29 Traefik 3.2 is here: 50% faster with the Fast Proxy 
  engine and Kubernetes Gateway API v1.2 support.

## Extending the Gateway API: The Power and Challenges of Policies 

- Kate Osborn, NGINX

... From the beginning, the Gateway API has been designed to be 
extensible ... over 25 implementations ... Among the various ways ... 
Policy Attachment mechanism stands out as the most potent and 
challenging.

You will learn about:
- The difference between direct and inherited policies.
- How policy inheritance and merging works. 
- Corner cases, such as conflicting policies and invalid target refs.
- Techniques to verify if a policy has been successfully applied.
- Strategies for troubleshooting policies.
