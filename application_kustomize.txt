## Kustomize  
* Kustomize compares to Helm&Helm Charts.

* C&P from https://foghornconsulting.com/2022/01/25/helm-versus-kustomize/<br/>
  """
  To boil it all down to its base elements, Helm encapsulates
  Kubernetes objects into a single deployable unit and hides a lot of
  the complexity. Kustomize exposes everything and allows for more
  surgical changes that can change anything in a Kubernetes manifest.

  Kustomize lets you customize raw, template-free YAML
  files for multiple purposes, leaving the original YAML untouched and usable as is.

### Kustomize vs Helm vs Kubes 
* <https://blog.boltops.com/2020/11/05/kustomize-vs-helm-vs-kubes-kubernetes-deploy-tools>

> ...Kubes is another tool that handles deployment.
> Kubes has some similar concepts to both Kustomize and Helm and improves on them.
> ...Kubes introduces a conventional folder structure. Conventions takes you a long way.

* With Helm, you can also add templating methods with custom helpers.
  The helper method definitions are awkward looking, though. <br/>
  Example:`templates/_helpers.tpl`
  ```
  {{- define "demo.serviceAccountName" -}}
    {{- if .Values.serviceAccount.create }}
    {{- default (include "demo.fullname" .) .Values.serviceAccount.name }}
  {{- else }}
   {{- default "default" .Values.serviceAccount.name }}
  {{- end }}
  {{- end }}
  ```
* With Kubes, custom template helper definitions is just Ruby code.
  Example:.kubes/helpers/my_helpers.rbmodule MyHelpers
  ```
  def database_endpoint
    case Kubes.env
    when "dev"
      "dev-db.cbuqdmc3nqvb.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com"
    when "prod"
      "prod-db.cbuqdmc3nqvb.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com"
    end
  ```

* Helm supports packaging, Kubes no.
  Kubes supports OCI Image builds, helm doesn't.
