# Oterize

* Oterize offers an Istio alternative, simpler to  operate.
<https://www.kubetools.io/kubernetes/securely-scaling-microservices-on-kubernetes-with-otterize/>

""" Istio is known for its complexity, which can make it
 difficult to deploy and manage. It requires a steep
 learning curve, and its configuration can become
 complicated as the number of microservices grows. Otterize,
 on the other hand, is designed to be easy to deploy and
 manage. It is built specifically for Kubernetes, which
 means it integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes ConfigMaps
 and RBAC."""
