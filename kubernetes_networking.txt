# Kubernetes Networking

[[{network.SDN,network.CNI,network.101]]
## Software Defined Network (SDN) introduction 

REF: <https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/getting-started-sdn>


... SDNs allows projects to control network traffic in
  complex networking topologies through a centralized panel,
  rather than handling each network device, such as routers
  and switches, manually ("hierarchical" topology).

... sdn should increase security by isolating multiple
namespaces: by default containers from different namespaces
cannot send packets to or receive packets from pods  in a
different namespace.

... container network interface (CNI) is a library and a set
of tools to configure network interfaces in linux containers
through many supported plugins.
- N plugins can run simultaneously in a given container.
- networks use json configuration files ...

NOTE: SDN and CNI apply to the internal Kubernetes cluster 
network. They are ussualy complemented with API Managers
controlling incomming HTTP and TLS traffic.

## common CNI plugins include:

- calico:
  - high scalability.
  <https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.7/getting-started/kubernetes/>
  <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/network-policy-provider/calico-network-policy/>
- cilium:
  - provides network connectivity and load balancing
    between application workloads, such as application
    containers and processes, and ensures transparent security.
- contiv:
  - integrates containers, virtualization, and physical servers
    based on the container network using a single networking fabric.
- contrail :
  - provides overlay networking for multi-cloud and
    hybrid cloud through network policy enforcement.
- flannel :
  - makes it easier for developers to configure a layer 3
    network fabric for kubernetes.
- multus :
  - supports multiple network interfaces in a single pod on
    kubernetes for sriov, sriov-dpdk, ovs-dpdk, and vpp workloads.
- open vswitch (ovs) :
  - production-grade cni platform with a standard management
    interface on openshift and openstack.
- ovn-kubernetes :
  - enables virtual networks for multiple containers on different
    hosts using an overlay function.
- romana :
  - makes cloud network functions less expensive to build,
    easier to operate, and better performing than traditional
    cloud networks.
