## Kogito 
* <https://kogito.kie.org/get-started/>
* cloud-native business automation
  The name Kogito derives from the Latin "Cogito", as in
  "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"),
  and is pronounced [ˈkoː.d͡ʒi.to] (KO-jee-to).
* "Knowledge Is Everything (KIE)" open source business
  automation project from which Kogito originates.
* The core objective of Kogito is to help you mold a set of business
  processes and decisions into your own domain-specific cloud-native
  set of services.
* When using Kogito, you are building a cloud-native application
  as a set of independent domain-specific services, collaborating
  to achieve some business value.
* The processes and decisions that you use to describe the target
  behavior are executed as part of the services that you create.
  The resulting services are highly distributed and scalable with no
  centralized orchestration service, and the runtime that your service
  uses is optimized for what your service needs.
* Kogito includes components that are based on well-known business
  automation KIE projects, specifically Drools, jBPM, and OptaPlanner,
  to offer dependable, open source solutions for business rules,
  business processes, and constraint solving.
Some examples:
* dmn-quarkus-example and dmn-springboot-example:
  A decision service that uses DMN to determine driver
  penalty and suspension based on traffic violations
* rules-quarkus-helloworld: A Hello World decision service on
  Quarkus with a single DRL rule unit
* ruleunit-quarkus-example/ruleunit-springboot-example:
  decision service that uses DRL with rule units to validate
  a loan application and that exposes REST operations
  to view application status.
* process-quarkus-example and process-springboot-example: A process
  service (on Quarkus or Spring Boot) for ordering items and that
  exposes REST operations to create new orders or to list and delete
  active orders
* onboarding-example: A combination of a process service and two
  decision services that use DMN and DRL for onboarding new employees
* kogito-travel-agency: A combination of process services and
  decision services that use DRL and XLS for travel booking, intended
  for deployment on OpenShift
