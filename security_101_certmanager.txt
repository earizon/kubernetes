##  Going Secretless with Cert-Manager

 ...managing secrets securely is a challenge. Traditional methods often involve
complex configurations with secret vaults, secret syncing and secret backups.
... secrets always come with a risk of being leaked.

**Most of the secrets used in traditional applications can be replaced by short-lived certificates
 Applications can prove to be the owner of a certificate without sharing any secrets** 
 In Kubernetes, cert-manager can be used to provision these certificates to all applications
without sharing any secret information.  [[doc_has.keypoint]]

## SPIFFE: Universal X509 and JWT Identities Using Cert-Manager

 ..SPIFFE is incredible. **Each workload is assigned its own universal identity**,
simplifying the security and management of communications in distributed systems.

 While SPIRE (the reference SPIFFE implementation) is exceptionally powerful, 
it is also quite complex. ... it requires StatefulSets, which can be challenging 
and frustrating.

...  Many cloud vendors are starting to offer vendor lock-in SPIFFE solutions

...  In this talk, we will demonstrate how to use the Cloud Native cert-manager 
solution to implement SPIFFE (x509 and JWT) with low operational overhead for
all Kubernetes workloads.

- The session includes all you need to know to issue X.509 SVIDs, use them and validate them.
- we will introduce an experimental solution to convert x509 SVIDs into JWT SVIDs.
- The demo will highlight how to authenticate to third-party APIs (such as AWS, GCP,
  Azure, and others) using these JWT SVIDs.

- Who is Who:
  - Ashley Davis Staff Software Engineer, Venafi
  - Tim Ramlot Senior Software Engineer - cert-manager maintainer, Venafi

- Example: Istio use the SPIFFE spec to distribute mTLS certificates.


## Poster Session (PS06): What's Happening with SPIFFE and WIMSE? - Daniel Feldman, Qusaic

... This session will be a very brief overview of what's going on with 
  the SPIFFE and WIMSE identity standards projects.

... WIMSE is an IETF effort to build on the SPIFFE foundation.

... In particular, it adds a new, unique token format that allows securely recording multi-hop identity information. 

... Implementors will be able to use this token format to build complete, end-to-end, cryptographically auditable identity records.

### Intro & In-Depth Exploration of the Upcoming Forced Rotation and Revocation Feature

( by Agustín Martínez Fayó & Marcos Yacob, Hewlett Packard Enterprise)

... foundational aspects of SPIRE, detailing its architecture, capabilities, and the problems it solves

... focus on the highly anticipated forced rotation and revocation feature that will provide a rapid,
reliable, and automated mechanism for recovering from key compromise.
