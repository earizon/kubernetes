## git-sync "sidecar" [[{qa.gitops,application.sidecar,PM.TODO]]
<https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync>
* simple command that pulls a git HEAD|tag|hash repo into
  a local dir. It is a perfect "sidecar" container in Kubernetes -
* it can periodically pull files down from a repository so that an
  application can consume them.
  It will only re-pull if the target of the run has changed in
  the upstream repository. When it re-pulls, it updates the destination
  directory atomically. In order to do this, it uses a git worktree in
  a subdirectory of the --root and flips a symlink.
* A webhook call upon successful git repo synch is allowed after the
  symlink is updated.
