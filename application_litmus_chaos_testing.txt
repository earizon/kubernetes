Chaos Engineering Kubernetes with the Litmus Framework

- open source chaos engineering framework for Kubernetes
  environments running stateful applications.
- Litmus can be added to CI/CD pipelines
- designed to catch hard-to-detect bugs in Kubernetes
  that might be missed by unit or integration tests.
- focus on application resilience:
  - pre-existing tests for undesirable behavior such:
    - container crash
    - disk failure
    - or network delay
    - packet loss.
- can also be used to determine if a Kubernetes deployment
  is suitable for stateful workloads.
