## Gatekeeper policy controls

* The Open Policy Agent project (OPA) provides a way to create policies
  across cloud-native application stacks, from ingress to service-mesh
  components to Kubernetes. More info available at:
  <../Cloud/cloud_map.html#OPA_Summary>
* OPA DECOUPLES POLICY DECISION-MAKING FROM POLICY ENFORCEMENT.
* Gatekeeper provides a Kubernetes-native way to enforce OPA
  policies on a cluster automatically, and to audit for any events or
  resources violating policy. All this is handled by a relatively new
  mechanism in Kubernetes, admission controller Webhooks, that fire on
  changes to resources. With Gatekeeper, OPA policies can be maintained
  as just another part of your Kubernetes cluster's defined state,
  without needing constant babysitting.

## Teleport 
* implement industry-best practices for SSH and Kubernetes access,
  meet compliance requirements, and have complete visibility into access and behavior.
* Security best practices out-of-the-box.
* Isolate critical infra and enforce 2FA with SSH and Kubernetes.
* Provide role-based access controls (RBAC) using short-lived
  certificates and your existing identity management service.
* Log events and record session activity for full auditability.

## Kubecost 
- monitor "the dollars" cost of running Kubernetes?

- Kubecost uses real-time Kubernetes metrics, and real-world cost
  information derived from running clusters on the major cloud
  providers, to provide a dashboard view of the monthly cost of each
  cluster deployment. Costs for memory, CPU, GPU, and storage are all
  broken out by Kubernetes component (container, pod, service,
  deployment, etc.).

- Kubecost can also track the costs of “out of cluster” resources,
  such as Amazon S3 buckets, although this is currently limited to AWS.

- Kubecost is free to use if you only need to keep 15 days of logs. For
  more advanced features, pricing starts at $199 per month for
  monitoring 50 nodes.

## Auditing users/admins/others
<https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/>
* Kubernetes auditing provides a security-relevant chronological set of
  records documenting the sequence of activities that have affected
  system by individual users, administrators or other components of the
  system. It allows cluster administrator to answer the following
  questions:
  * what happened?
  * when did it happen?
  * who initiated it?
  * on what did it happen?
  * where was it observed?
  * from where was it initiated?
  * to where was it going?
